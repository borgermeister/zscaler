# Zscaler - Automation with Ansible

This repository contains the Ansible playbooks and roles for automating Zscaler configuration and management.

## Requirements

There are several ways to install Ansible on your system. One way is to use the `pip` package manager, or you can run Ansible from a Docker container.
In this example I have chosen to install Ansible using [Devbox](https://www.jetify.com/devbox) and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).
